### Stake CAKE, earn CAKE!

PancakeSwap now offers one CAKE Syrup Pool with two staking options: flexible staking or fixed-term staking. Keep reading on to learn more!

## What’s the difference between “Flexible” and “Fixed-Term”?

**With both pools, you can simply stake your CAKE tokens to earn more CAKE tokens with no deposit fees.**&#x20;

But there are differences:

### Flexible Staking

Stake your CAKE and forget about it! The CAKE you stake in this Syrup Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee (same as old Auto CAKE Syrup Pool).

**Unstaking fee**&#x20;

* **0.1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more CAKE in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 CAKE, then 0.02 CAKE would be subtracted as the performance fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
The CAKE collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular CAKE token burns.&#x20;

This is a good thing for CAKE holders because it reduces the overall amount of CAKE tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### Fixed-Term Staking

Stake your CAKE for a fixed amount of time to maximize yields and receive additional benefits! The staked CAKE will be automatically compounded during the entire lock duration. 

* No performance fees
* The longer you lock, the higher the boost applied on the yield!
* CAKE rewards are auto-compounded and will unlock, along with your staked CAKE, when your lock duration expires
* Once staked in fixed-term staking, you cannot withdraw until the end of your lock duration
* IFO CAKE credit (the maximum amount of CAKE they can commit during an IFO) will be determined from fixed-term staking pool
